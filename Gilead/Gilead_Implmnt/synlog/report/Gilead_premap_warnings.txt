@W: MT529 :"c:\users\nicky\documents\github\thedarktower\gilead\verilog_files\shiftclkgenerator.v":12:0:12:5|Found inferred clock DarkTower|CLOCK_16 which controls 8 sequential elements including shiftRegisterClkInstance.shiftClkGeneratorInstance.counter[2:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
